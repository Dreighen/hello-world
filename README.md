Just following the Github tuts to learn more about this amazing platform!

Brief Bio:

Hello, my name is Marvin and I am a Front-End Developer. I am an Army Vet, father of two wonderful children. My hobbies include web design/dev, user experience design, poker, trading, fitness, culinary arts, music, science and so much more. I am a life-long student, always striving to learn something new every single day.

I still consider myself very new to web design/dev even though I did obtain my Associates Degree in the topic. Right now I am currently building my knowledge base, while working on building my client base next. I look forward to learning and using Github as much as possible in the near future!
